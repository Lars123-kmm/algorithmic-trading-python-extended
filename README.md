# Algorithmic Trading with Python – Extended Project

This repository is based on the material presented in *“Python for Finance and Algorithmic Trading (2nd edition)”* by Lucas Ingelse*.  
The project extends and adapts the concepts from the book in order to build a structured and modular environment for quantitative trading research, strategy development, and performance evaluation.

## Overview

The repository provides an extended implementation of core components used in algorithmic trading, including data preparation, feature engineering, strategy design, backtesting, and model analysis.  
The objective is to create a flexible framework that can be expanded with additional strategies, metrics, and machine learning models.

## Project Scope

The project covers the following areas:

- Data handling and preprocessing for financial time series  
- Construction of technical and statistical features  
- Implementation of traditional and machine learning–based trading strategies  
- Backtesting workflows including walk-forward and rolling-window procedures  
- Evaluation and comparison of strategies using established performance metrics  
- Visualization of time-series data, equity curves, and analytical summaries  

## Technologies and Libraries

The project primarily uses Python and leverages established libraries for quantitative finance and data science:

- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- MetaTrader 5 API (optional)  

## Objectives

The aim of this project is to create an extensible platform for research and experimentation in algorithmic trading.  
It expands upon the methods presented in the book and adapts them to a broader, research-oriented context.  
The system supports the development of additional trading strategies, the use of advanced performance metrics, and the integration of feature engineering and machine learning techniques.
